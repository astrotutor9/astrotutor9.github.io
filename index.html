    <h1>Arduino and Raspberry Pi Builds</h1>

    <h2>Starting simple.</h2>
        <p>Build something that interests you. Personally I'm not a video games fan. I've always 
            liked the idea that a computer can do <strong>something really different</strong>
            for you. You can have control over the computer using it to tell you something you couldn't find out another
            way.</p>

        <h1>Fast hummus recipe</h1>

        <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a 
            number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>
    
        <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
            It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
            <li>175g of tahini</li>
            <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
            <li>Half a red pepper</li>
            <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Method</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
            <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
            <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
            <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
                <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    
        <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and 
            coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and 
            feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>
    
        <h2>Storage</h2>
    
        <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it 
            for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should 
            definitely discard it.</p>
    
        <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
